Coyote - Not bad, Axx. Yesterday was pretty smooth.
Axx - What can I say, I'm good at what I do.
Coyote - Why do you think you got the job?
Axx - I always thought it was just my charm and dashing sense of style.
Coyote - I don't think those'll help you today, kid. We've got sightings.
Axx - HBs?
Coyote - You bet your city-slicker rear-end. Cameras caught wind o' some Honey Badgers makin' moves in the night. Best be on the lookout.
Axx - Got anything I can use to help? Well, apart from my eyes.
Coyote - I pulled a couple strings and got you some traps. You're gonna want to keep 'em away from the other badgers, though. They're not pit-proof.
Axx - Then how am I supposed to get them?
Coyote - See your signs there? HBs'll likely tell 'em to stick it where the sun don't shine. So you might wanna set 'em up so it leads those honey-munchin' cobra-busters right towards them traps of yours. G'luck, Kid.
