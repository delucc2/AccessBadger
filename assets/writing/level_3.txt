Coyote - Better pick up the pace, kid.
Axx - Huh?
Coyote - You did some nice work with those HBs yesterday, but we've got more comin' today. Seems they can't stand the idea of badgers breedin' their own earthworms down here.
Axx - We're not messing with their food, so why the hell are they trying to screw with ours?
Coyote - Well that would imply these lion-fightin', rabble-rousin', stripe-backs've got neurological and psychological ability ta process reason 'n logical thought.
Axx - Don't they?
Coyote - Even if they do, you'd still be forgettin' one crucial detail.
Axx - Which would be...?
Coyote - Honey Badgers don't give a f***. Good luck, Kid.
