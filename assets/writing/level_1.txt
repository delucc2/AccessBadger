Coyote - Alright, Axx. Settled in?
Axx - Of course.
Coyote - Good. Better get excited. First day as Security Chief and you already get to deal with an incursion.
Axx - Incursion? You told me we were secure, Coyote.
Coyote - We are now, but keep an eye out. Honey Badgers tried breakin' in a few nights back. Been switching up the security lanes since to try and confound 'em.
Axx - I was wondering why everything was switched around.
Coyote - Yup, plus now we've got you in control.
Axx - What do you mean?
Coyote - See those buttons on your console? You can start swapping around that floor plan with the walls and switches and whatnot before the work day starts. Best not change things around too much once badgers start comin' through, though.
Axx - Right. I'll just stick to throwing switches.
Coyote - Sure thing. Just make sure you get those badgers through the right gates or they won't be able to get into their projects.
Axx - No problem. Best get things settled, then. Over and out.
Coyote - Over and out.
